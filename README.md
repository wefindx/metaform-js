# metaform-js

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/wefindx/metaform](https://badges.gitter.im/djrobstep/csvx.svg)](https://gitter.im/wefindx/metaform)  
Javascript/Typescript port for [metaform](https://github.com/wefindx/metaform), a utility, generator, manager, and coordinator for metadata and schemas.

## What makes metaform-js cool?

* It is modularized. You can launch a full-fledged type and schema manager out of metaform-js, or you can just use its schema extractor utility. Just import the files and if you use something like webpack or babel, they'll handle it for you hassle-free!
